xUniverse is expanding - distances between distant objects are increasing
xEverywhere we look, distant objects are receeding. The further the object, the faster.
xEasiest explanation is expansion.
Balloon picture
xRubber band example
xMENTI question: Does the solar/system get bigger due to expansion? Do you?
xRubber band example with bound system
xWhat does recession velocity mean? Objects are 'moving'. SR doesn't apply.
xQuoting the speed of expansion
xCurrent expansion rate. H0. 70 km/s/Mpc
xMENTI question: Poe
xHistory - Not part of early cosmologies. Poe (1848). Then 20th century.
xWhy does the Universe expand? Initial condition; subsequent behaviour set by gravity.
xWhy Gravity? Modern theory of gravity. Picture; Einstein.
xMass/energy affects distances/angles. So contents of Universe affect expansion.
xFreidmann wrote down the equations. Picture: Freidmann.
xLamaitre; big bang
[Contents of Universe? or do this later?]
xMeasuring expansion rate. Need recession velocity and distance
xMENTI question: Which is easier to measure?
Speed from Doppler-like shift in spectrum - relatively easy. Picture: Vesto Slipher. First to relate redshifts to distance.
Distance - parallax, but only so far.
Standard candles. Cepheids. Picture: Henrietta Swan Leavitt.
Hubble (1929) assembled the results. Picture: Hubble. Hubble graph.
MENTI question: What H0 does this give?
Result: H0 = 700 km/s/Mpc. Wrong!
Trimble graph. 5 distinct amendments made over next 40 years, to get H0 between 50 and 100.
Almost everyone underestimated their errors!
HST. Picture Wendy Freedman.
Currently (at least) 3 methods for measuring H0: parallax+cepheids+supernovae, CMB, gravitational waves
Some discrepancy - should this be a worry?
